What is Inspect?
----------------

Inspect is a small library to inspect arbitrary OCaml values and their
associated object graph by either dumping them as S-expressions (with
sharing and references), or by writing output in the DOT-language
which can then be further processed by Graphviz
(http://www.graphviz.org/).

Inspect was originally written by Kaspar M. Rohrer
(kaspar.rohrer@gmail.com).
