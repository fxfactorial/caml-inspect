This small library can be used to inspect arbitrary OCaml values,
either by dumping the object graph as pretty printed S-expressions
with references and sharing, or by generating output in the
DOT-language to be further processed by Graphviz. This functionality
is provided by the {!module: Sexpr} and {!module: Dot} sub-modules.

{2 Dumping S-Expressions}

Context objects are used to configure the dumping process, and
sensible default contexts are already provided in the respective sub
modules.

{2 Dumping Graphviz DOT}

If you are on OS X and have Graphviz installed, you can try the
[Inspect.Dot.dump_command] function to dump directly to a temporary
PDF file, which will then be opened in Preview.
